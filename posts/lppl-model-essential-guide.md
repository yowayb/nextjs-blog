LPPL (log-periodic power law) patterns are observed in nature and financial markets and are crucial to understanding trading dynamics. Their origins lie in the tendencies of social networks, specifically imitative behaviors.
Sociodynamics: An Emerging Field

Social dynamics (or sociodynamics) is the study of group behavior that results from individuals' interactions. Sociodynamics focuses on structuring social groups, information dissemination, and opinion shifts.

Core to sociodynamics is understanding hierarchical networks, with individuals represented as nodes. Here, parallels to the longstanding Ising model from physics, initially developed to study magnetism, become evident.

Similarly to magnetism, we can study how individuals are influenced by neighbors in their network.
